        Hi there! My name is Yuxin Zeng and Iâ€™m an upcoming Senior at Malden High, located in a suburb right outside Boston. I enjoy challenging myself in my academics and always pushing myself to learning and trying new things. In the near future, I hope to pursue a career either within technology or healthcare and am fascinated in learning about the bridge between the two fields. 
      </p>
      
    <p class="introB">
        Outside of school I enjoy playing musical instruments (guitar and piano), listening to music (check out my Spotify), reading books of the fiction genre, editing videos and photos, and doing different art projects!
