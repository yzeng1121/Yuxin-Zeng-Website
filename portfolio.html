    Last year, I took an engineering class and was able to get the basics down for how to code a Microbit! For my collective group project, we created a hands-on Microbit game that was inspired by the toy <i>Bop It</i>. This was the start to my fascination for programming and technology.

    I make little edits on my very phone using the apps <i>Alight Motion</i> and <i>Cute Cut Pro</i> and post them on my Instagram account! This hobby is another way for me to express myself creatively, and I've been making video edits since middle school!
